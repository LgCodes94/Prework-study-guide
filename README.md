# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My Motivation is to start a new career in the tech industry. Becoming a software engineer is a passion of mine. This was a good project to start out with. It gave me some basic fundamentals, although I was lost in some cases. This is a great reference to look back on in the future. My goal is to keep building this study guide for my personal use and share it with anyone else that is interested in pressuring a job in tech. I ran into a few issues with transferring the code from VS code, git bash to github. I overcame this by going back to the prework, researching online in google, watching videos in youtube and more than anything kept practicing how to code.

The Prework is very simple to understand. It gives you step by step instructions. This is a great way to start building your foundation or at least get a small peak of what the coding boot camp will teach and offer.
